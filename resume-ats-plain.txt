TECHNICAL PROJECTS
Artificial Intelligence–Based Voice Assistant                              Aug 2023 – Apr 2024
UG Capstone Project (Academic Project Lead)
• Designed and implemented a voice-assistant workflow for conversational interaction, including intent handling and response generation.
• Built and trained sequence models (RNN/LSTM/GRU) for intent classification using Python with PyTorch/TensorFlow (Keras) and supporting libraries (NumPy/Librosa).
• Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering (tokenization/padding/embeddings; audio/text processing) and conducted error analysis to improve model reliability.
• Evaluated model performance using train/validation testing and reported 92% intent detection accuracy on a custom dataset; delivered a working demo and documentation.
• Led technical discussions and project reviews with faculty/peers; delivered documentation covering methodology, experiments, and results.
